It can be useful for spesific targets and also u can use with badusb.

This code created for ethical hacking students. All responsibility on you ;)

Special thanks to https://github.com/nihatyldz42 for his support.

# Usage

1) Change sender, reciever and password informations in code,
2) Use pyinstaller for convert to EXE => pyinstaller stealwifi.py --onefile
3) If you know how to make FUD malware, u can work on it. But, if you convert to EXE directly, Windows Defender will not block EXE file.
4) You have to write EXE files name in the code, before make EXE file. So, when you get creds by mail, all files will be deleted automatically.
